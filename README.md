# Mirth Syntax Highlighting

This is the syntax highlighting config for using highlight.js on mirth code.

Mirth is a new strongly-typed concatenative programming language.

It is inspired by Forth, Joy, Haskell, Lisp, and monoidal category theory. 

Mirth's compiler can be found [here](https://github.com/mirth-lang/mirth)
